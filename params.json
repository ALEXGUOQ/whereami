{"name":"whereami","tagline":"get your location at the command line","body":"### What is it, and how to use it\r\n\r\n`whereami` is the simplest way to get your location when at the command line. In the simplest form, just invoke the command and it will respond with your location coordinates:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ whereami\r\n41.386905825791,2.14425782089087\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need fancier output, you can pass `--format json` or `--format sexagesimal` to get the output in the corresponding format:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ whereami --format json\r\n{\"latitude\":41.386905825791, \"longitude\": 2.14425782089087}\r\n$ whereami --format sexagesimal\r\n41° 23′ 12.8609728477426″, 2° 8′ 39.3281552071449″\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other options\r\nIn addition to the above options, there's also the mandatory `--version` and `--help` options.\r\n\r\n### How to get it\r\nI'm working on getting it to work with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Meanwhile, head on to [the repo](https://github.com/victor/whereami) and follow the instructions there.\r\n\r\n### Hacking\r\nIf you want to get your hands dirty, contributions are welcome. Please check [the github repo](https://github.com/victor/whereami) for details.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
